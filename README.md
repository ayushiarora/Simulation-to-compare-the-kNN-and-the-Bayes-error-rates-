# Simulation-to-compare-the-kNN-and-the-Bayes-error-rates-

In this project we are going to generate a classiÔ¨Åcation data according to a known distribution. Since the distribution of the data can draw the decision boundaries of classes predicted by the Bayes decision rule. 
Next, we will generate data according to this distribution and use it along with the kNN model for best value of k for prediction; the best value of k is determined by 1-folding cross validation. Will compare the boundaries generates by the kNN and by the Bayes decision rule.
